# 🧠 Bank Customer Churn Prediction

This project explores and models customer churn behavior for a retail bank, aiming to identify high-risk segments and recommend data-driven retention strategies.

## 📊 Objectives
- Predict churn probability using historical customer data
- Explore patterns by age, country, product usage, and balance
- Build interpretable models (Logistic, XGBoost)
- Share actionable insights via visualizations and dashboards

## 📁 Project Structure
- `notebooks/`: Full data analysis and modeling code in Jupyter
- `data/`: Dataset used for training (optional)
- `images/`: EDA plots and correlation heatmaps
- `dashboard/`: Tableau visualizations
- `models/`: Saved ML models
- `final_report.md`: Project summary and business recommendations

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Tableau (for visual dashboard)
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 Key Results
- Churn Rate: 20.3%
- Older, inactive customers with 3+ products are high-risk
- Logistic Regression and XGBoost achieved 80%+ AUC
